### Run the Code 
1. Open the python notebook `Project3_405350265_605432345_105730045.ipynb`
2. The questions are solved sequentially. Find all the questions mentioned and the solutions below them. 
3. Question 6, question 8 and question 10 take a bit longer time to run. 

### Project Description
In this project we try to build recommender systems using the provided movie lens data. We try neighbourhood-based collaborative filtering, model-based collaborative filtering and naive-based collaborative filtering and compare their performances.  A more detailed report can be found in Project3_405350265_605432345_105730045.pdf report file.
